## Introduction

This document is made for and is to be used in Ticorporate environment and the contents of this document reflect that. It is **not** a comprehensive nor a perfect guide on how to act as a Product Owner. The document also assumes that the reader has basic knowledge about agile methods and spesifically Scrum but we will dip into the process too. On that subject we will look at the differences and procedures between Scrum team, Scrum Master and Product Owner.

## Project Owner?

The role of Product Owner is critical and often the hardest one in the Scrum team. Judy and Krumins-Beens [1] say that "*The product owner has gone from someone who could blame development if a project failed to someone who is responsible for the success or failure of the project.*" Simply put Product Owner is the person who takes business ideas and requirements and turns those into a product backlog but the role is much more than that. 

The Product Owner must find a balance between the business value, his own vision and what can be done in given time. In that way, the Product Owner is the person who connects it all. They negotiate with the stakeholders, they answer the Scrum teams questions and they collaborate with the Scrum Master.

It is important to realize that the PO isn't a committee, it is a role for single person. Scrum Guide defines that only one person is responsible for maintaining and sustaining the content and priority of the Product Backlog. If many team members give their inputs to the PB the product loses its vision, business requirements are not met and it opens a great number of problems with different stakeholders. That is not to say that PO can't or shouldn't take input from the team, in fact he should. However PO always has the last word on what goes to backlog and with what priority.

## Scrum Master and Product Owner

The roles of the Product Owner and the Scrum Master complement each other. Product Owner is responsible for what to do and Scrum Master is responsible for how to do it. It is impervious that the two persons have good communication, and that neither tries to step on the others toes.

## Scrum Master and Scrum Team

One of the main points of being a good Product Owner is being able to take responsibility and answer the Scrum Teams questions.
