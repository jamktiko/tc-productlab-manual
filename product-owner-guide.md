## Introduction

This document is made for and is to be used in Ticorporate environment and the contents of this document reflect that. It is **not** a comprehensive nor a perfect guide on how to act as a product owner. The document also assumes that the reader has basic knowledge about agile methods and spesifically Scrum but we will dip into the process too. On that subject we will look at the differences and procedures between Scrum team, Scrum Master and product owner. 

## Project Owner?

The role of product owner is critical and often the hardest one in the Scrum team. Judy and Krumins-Beens [1] say that "*The product owner has gone from someone who could blame development if a project failed to someone who is responsible for the success or failure of the project.*" Simply put the product owne##r in agile software development is responsible for that the development teams work produces as valuable as possible product.

The product owner must find a balance between the business value, his own vision and what can be done in given time. In that way, the product owner is the person who connects it all. They negotiate with the stakeholders, they answer the Scrum teams questions and they collaborate with the Scrum Master.

It is important to realize that the PO isn't a committee, it is a role for single person. Scrum Guide defines that only one person is responsible for maintaining and sustaining the content and priority of the Product Backlog. If many team members give their inputs to the PB the product loses its vision, business requirements are not met and it opens a great number of problems with different stakeholders. That is not to say that PO can't or shouldn't take input from the team. In fact they should. However PO always has the last word on what goes to backlog and with what priority.

### Product Owners responsibilities

X in his book, "Agile Game Development With Scrum" lists the following responsibilities for the product owner as follows:

* Managing the ROI (return of interest) for the game
* Establishing a shared vision for the game among the customers and developers
* Knowing what to build and in what order
* Creating release plans and establishing delivery dates
* Supporting sprint planning and reviews
* Establishing the "definition of done"

Even though he speaks of game development, all those things apply to software business too.

Lets expand those points a bit!

#### Managing the ROI

#### Establishing a shared vision

#### Product backlog

#### Releases

#### Sprint planning and reviews

#### Definition of Done & Conditions of satisfaction

Because PO is the bridge between stakeholders, SM, and the Scrum team he must also be the one to negotiate the definition of done. **Agreement on definition of done must happen before a story is broken into tasks**. This is because the stakeholders might expect production level quality when the team thinks that only placeholder art is needed for the feature. That is why definition of done is so important. Product owner can't accept the work if it doesn't satisfy this criteria. If the work *done* isn't actually **done** it causes debt which could, and most likely will, delay the project.

There are standard and additional definitions of done. The basic version applies to every story. For example this could mean that the system runs on development server without any bugs.

### Product owner and Scrum Master

The roles of the product owner and the Scrum Master complement each other. Product owner is responsible for what to do and Scrum Master is responsible for how to do it. It is impervious that the two persons have good communication, and that neither tries to step on the others toes.

### Product Owners at Ticorporate

During the Product Lab the faculty of BIT will arrange lectures and visits from industry members and experts. These will be announced on Microsoft Teams, on class and on the Ticorporate Calendar.
