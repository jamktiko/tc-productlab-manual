## Introduction

Ticorporate business simulation is based on "Information systems project" course, which has been part of Business Information Technologies degree programme from the start. Its purpose was to teach how to build information systems and how to do it as a part of a project group working towards a common goal. In the autumn of 2013 Information systems project course extended to include theory studies when "Software production", "project management", and "modeling information systems" courses were integrated into it. The newly founded course was named Ticorporate and its first iteration was called "Ticorporate MXIII". After the first Ticorporate the name was shortened to "TC" plus a rolling number. Now we are at TC6.

After few yearly incremental upgrades it was decided that Ticorporate as it was is at its end. The course was split in half and that process gave birth to Ticorporate Demolab and Ticorporate Productlab. Year after that, the course was pushed forwards half a year, causing Demolab to start on 2nd year BIT students spring semester and Productlab to start on 3rd year students autumn semester.

Demolab is mandatory for all BIT students and Productlab is a part of elective professional studies. Demolabs purpose is basically the same as it was in every other year, to teach students how software projects and its roles work and to build a strictly defined game or software in a group setting.

This document is created to describe objectives and activities of Productlab.

## Production process

The course is divided in four separate phases. These are concepting, pre-production, production and post-production.

### Concepting and grouping up

#### Monday

The day starts at 09:00 CEST at AP05 in Rajakatu campus. The Lecturer in Charge (or Labmaster) will say a few words an go through the structure, assessment, deliverables and anything else about the course.

When all the formalities are done it's time to start working. During the first day the students which have a certain ready made idea in mind and those who don't have any definitive idea. Those who would like to make a concept for completely new game or application/service are allowed to do so. 

#### Tuesday

#### Wednesday

#### Thursday

#### Friday

### Pre-production

Pre-production starts when the teams are ready. Groups will get to know eachother better and arranges a workspace to their needs and wants. Roles are selected based on the production model choosed. Chosen roles should include at least a Scrum Master, Product Owner and [a person in charge of Business side of things]. However, these roles should be discussed together with the team before starting pre-production.  

When the roles and workstations are clear the groups will move on to the pre-production tasks. Pre-production can take as long as the group needs, but it shouldn't take too much time. Usually a full week should be enough. Labmaster (or Lecturer in Charge) will go through the pre-production material and discuss with the team about their findings.

The items that should be delivered during pre-production

* Project plan
* Business plan
* Either
  * Game Design Document
  * Feasibility Study

Note that these documents are almost in a state of change.

It's also recommended to use the document templates in the provided GitHub repository.

### Production

Will happen in a chosen manner by the group and it will start when the group is ready. During this production phase there will be two meetings with the team. These meetings are designed to help and guide the team to right direction by BIT lecturers and relevant industry members. During production the teams will be able to co-operate with Digi & Game centre project. During production phase the team should focus on efficiently and methodically building new features and planning business opportunies. 

The goal of production phase is to build a product or a service which has business [prerequisities** ???]. During Product Lab production phase the teams will have visits and lecturers from industry members to help them develope their project and business plan towards release. 

### Post-production

At this stage, project implementation and best practices are collected and reported alongside with the lessons learned from the project for future use. At least the following operations shall be carried out during post-production

* Pitching competition
* Project closing report
  * Including contingency  plans
* Release if applicable
* Creation of personal career portfolio and demonstrations during demonstration day

## Pitching competition, career portfolio and demonstration day

### Pitching competition  

The project grade of this Ticorporate Product Lab comes wholly from the pitching competition. It will be judged by BIT lecturers and industry specialists. Time and place will be announced at a later date

#### Assessment criteria and guidelines

To be decided

### Career portfolio

The aim of the career portfolio is to show acquired skills with a view to applying for jobs in the field. In practice, there should be two parts one's own skills and a self-assessment. A comprehensive and representative collection of samples of the work done during the course is selected for the career portfolio. The career  portfolio is compiled from the base portfolio. During the course, the student collects all the material related to their know-how: essays, abstracts, reports, drafts and intermediate work, in addition to the actual work. In addition, it is a good idea to store all feedback and evaluations, self-assessments and analyzes, notes, concept maps, pictures and photos, learning diaries, or other logs of this kind in your basic portfolio. Although the evaluation only measures the implementation and presentation of the career portfolio, the basic portfolio is a good tool and it describes the development of individual skills over time. If the basic portfolio is done well and carefully, it can be used to assess and analyze the development of one's own skills.

In the career portfolio, the student tells about their own skills and it describes the student's strengths, views and areas for further study. As an appendix to this analysis, the student attaches samples of the best work (and/or what they are the proudest of) they have done for the project. What is noteworthy, especially for game content creators, is the fact that employers often want to see the workflow and intermediate results in career portfolios, not just the end results.

It is a good idea to start the portfolio building with a learning plan. **What can I do now** and **what will I learn** during the course? This plan will make your work goal-oriented and help you critically examine your own work. After that, the student should actively collect material for their basic portfolio according to their own plan. It is also advisable to maintain active self-evaluation (similar to a learning diary), where the student is an active participant in the development of their own skills. Towards the end of the course, the student builds their own career portfolio and builds it on the basis of the final presentation day. The demonstration and the career portfolio will look different for every student. However, the following questions should be considered when preparing your presentation:

* What have I learned and realized?
* What goals were achieved and which were not achieved?
* What did I learn outside the learning plan?
* How do I see my future
   * What kind of job do I want to get into?
   * How did the course support those goals?
   * What other know-how do I need to acquire to reach my goal?
* What are my strengths and have they been clarified?
* Why did I choose these documents / works for my career portfolio?

There are many ways to build a career portfolio. It can be a standard directory and is intended to be used, for example, in a job interview to support the display of one's skills. However, it is often the case in the digital field that the career portfolio is available in the internet. This often involves using services such as LinkedIn or GitHub Pages to publish information or building a website to support your expertise. Video services like YouTube have also gained popularity as a channel for sharing expertise. Whatever the technical implementation, you should reassure the assessors on the day of your demonstration of your expertise and its development during the course.

### Demonstration day

The career portfolios will be presented on the demonstration day. The goal of the day is to make everyone's skills and their development are visible and assessed. There are three main areas in which the students are assessed. Technology, content production and business. Each student participates in only one depending on the subject in which they have mainly done their work in. Each student has 30min to convince the panel of their expertise. 20min for portfolio presentation and 10min for discussion and questions. The jury consist of relevant BIT staff. 

#### Exeution of demonstration day

Implementation proceeds according to the following process

1. The student uploads their portfolio (.zip or a document with a link to a public portfolio) to the workspace return folder
2. The student picks the best time for their presentation from a list of time in the workspace.
3. The student will arrive at the room listed on the booking list with the work and presentation tools required to present the portfolio (including a computer if the presentation is digital). The student will have access to a video projector or a large display.
4. The student presents their portfolio as described in the previous subchapter and agreed upon with the teacher/labmaster/coach.
5. The jury will make an assessment decision and write the feedback in the return folder.
