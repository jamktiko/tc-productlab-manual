Version 0.5.2

* Labmaster & Lecturer in Charge = Antony Smal (antony.smal@jamk.fi)

## Introduction

Ticorporate Labs are based on olden golden "Information Systems Project" -course, which has been part of Business Information Technologies degree programme from the start. Its purpose was to teach how to build information systems and how to do it as a part of a project group working towards a common goal. In the autumn of 2013 "Information Systems Project" -course was extended to include theory studies, when "Software production", "project management", and "modelling information systems" courses were integrated into it. The newly founded course was named Ticorporate and its first iteration was called "Ticorporate MXIII". After the first Ticorporate the name was shortened to "Ticorporate" plus a rolling number. We use the name TC and Ticorporate interchangeably. At this point in time we are at TC8.

After few yearly incremental upgrades it was decided that Ticorporate as it was is at its end. The course was split in half and that process gave birth to Ticorporate Demo Lab and Ticorporate Product Lab. Year after that, the course was pushed forwards half a year, causing Demo Lab to start on 2nd year BIT students spring semester and Product Lab to start on 3rd year students autumn semester.

Demo Lab is mandatory for all BIT students and Product Lab is a part of elective professional studies. Demo Labs purpose is basically the same as it was in every other year, to teach students how software projects and its roles work and to build a strictly defined game or software in a group setting. Product Labs purpose is to give students a chance to prove their worth and teach them how to create financially responsible product

**This document is created to describe objectives and activities of Ticorporate Product Lab 9.**

## Application phase

### Pre-requirements

Two most important pre-requirements in Product Lab are:

* Self leadership skills
* Independency

As prerequisites you should possess skills in one or more key areas. Content production is the first. Meaning that you should be able to create content either using 2D or 3D tools, or be able to create special effects (particles, shader graph, etc) or know how to create beautiful UI's and good UX. Second key area is business skills. This means marketing, sales, product development, pitching and everything relating to that. It can also be entrepreneurship skills or experience. Third key area is technological skills. This means programming, testing, cloud or on-prem infrastructure. It can also mean tech art. On top of all these you should have some experience on working in a project and some project development skills.

### Application 

As of Product Lab 8 the application is used to gauge interest in joining the course. Based on the responses there, the Labmaster will be contacting industry specialists to join Product Lab as coaches. You can join the first lecture even if you have not filled the application form, but doing so is heavily recommended if you plan on participating. You can find the application form from here: Enrolment for the Product Lab VII happens is open from 2nd of August to 5th of September.

## Production process

The course is divided in four separate phases. These are concepting, pre-production, production and post-production.

### Concepting and grouping up

The course starts with concepting and "mingling" part. Since we have groups with ready made concept, people with ideas and people without ideas the first weeks purpose is to try and match all those people into a group and get them a productive role in the grand scheme of things. This week will be quite open ended and the execution will depend on which kind of students are attending the course. 

During the week Labmaster will be available for few hours a day. 

#### First day of Ticorporate Product Lab IX

Monday 16th of January we start at 13:00 EEST (Finnish time) at Digi & Game Center at Matarankatu. The Lecturer in Charge (or Labmaster) will give introductory speech to Ticorporate, and go through the structure, assessment, deliverables and give general information about the course. Depending a bit on the schedules, the team coaches will be introducing themselves here as well.

When all the formalities are done it's time to start working. During the first day the students should introduce themselves to other students and get to know each other. This can be done via multitude of methods. 

This is the place in time where the students whom have a ready made idea (or a ready made demo, created in Demo Lab) should introduce it to other students as well. Those who don't have a group, (and possibly have ideas) should try and organically create groups or pairs where they can create a new product concept for new game or application/service.

#### Gate 1

On Wednesday 18th of January at 09:30 - 12:45 we will all gather to Digi & Game Center to hear the first product ideas from inside of Ticorporate. At this point everyone should have some kind of concept and/or idea on what kind of product they would like to work on and in what role they would do the said work.

Presentations will happen in no particular order and they will be assessed by the labmaster and peers. The concepts will be assessed by 5 criteria. The labmaster will provide further instructions at the start of the meeting.

* Can you make money out of the concept
* How interesting the concept is
* How much would you want to work on the concept/project
* Scope and feasibility of the concept
* How "new" and innovative the concept/idea is

After the initial pitches, we will discuss the concepts and assessments together and decide which concepts are the ones we are going forwards with. This is where we organically create the groups for the concepts. Remember, you are not entitled to a group. The agreement to join a group must be mutual. You can complete the course as a "one person group" if you so wish. After this discussion, we should have X amount of projects which have defined groups. People can work crisscross and do the work on multiple projects but the working hours must be marked clearly and understandably for each and every project since those hours are the amount of ECTS given to each person. 


### Pre-production

Pre-production starts when the teams are ready. Groups will get to know each other better and arranges a workspace to their needs and wants. Roles are selected based on the production model chosen. Chosen roles should include at least a Scrum Master, Product Owner and [a person in charge of Business side of things]. However, these roles should be discussed together with the team before starting pre-production.  

When the roles and workstations are clear the groups will move on to the pre-production tasks. Pre-production can take as long as the group needs, but it shouldn't take too much time. Week, two or three should be enough. During this time, the teams should test their product idea with the potential customer base to better define what the idea is. Labmaster and coaches will go through the pre-production material and discuss with the team about their findings. 

The items that should be delivered during pre-production

* Project plan
* Business plan
* Either/both
  * Game Design Document
  * Feasibility Study

Note that these documents are almost in a state of change.

It's also recommended to use the document templates in the provided GitHub repository.

### Production

Will happen in a chosen manner by the group and it will start when the group is ready. During this production phase there will be about bi-weekly meetings with the team and the coaches. These meetings are designed to help and guide the team to right direction by BIT lecturers and relevant industry members. The schedule and date of these meetings is open ended, and will be agreed upon by the team and the coaches. During production phase the team should focus on efficiently and methodically building new features and planning business opportunies. 

The production phase should aim to produce some amount of complete work. It is up to the team to decide wether they want to:

* Create a vertical slice of a game
* Create a prototype of a game or a product
* Complete/polish a ready made demo
* Something completely different

The goal of production phase is to build a product or a service which has business prerequisites. During Product Lab production phase the teams will have visits and lecturers from industry members to help them develop their project and business plan towards release.

#### Brand packages

During the Product Lab the teams will make brand packages for their products. Jyväskylä University of Applied Sciences will provide the necessary resources for it. The package includes at least a t-shirt, hoodie, some business cards and a roll up. Some of the design elements will be mandated by JAMK. 


### Post-production

At this stage, project implementation and best practices are collected and reported alongside with the lessons learned from the project for future use. At least the following operations shall be carried out during post-production.

* Pitching competition
* Project closing report
  * Including contingency plans
    * Pre-incubator, incubator, etc
* Release if applicable

## Pitching competition, career portfolio and demonstration day

### Pitching competition  

The grade of this Ticorporate Product Lab comes wholly from the Dragons' Den event. It will be judged by BIT lecturers and industry specialists. It will be held on 15th of December at Digi and Game Center.

It is an open event which means that the teams can invite quests and that other students may attend it and watch the pitches.

The teams have around an hour to present their business idea & achievements during Product Lab and convince the judges (BIT staff, industry specialists).

The presentation/pitch should include at least the vision of the product, team members and the amount of hours put into the project per member and future plans after Product Lab ends. The form of the pitch is open and the team should make it look like their own. There is no single one blueprint that works.

#### Assessment criteria and guidelines

##### 1. The Big Idea

The first thing we look at when evaluating the grade is the idea and the vision of the product. What problem does this product aim to solve or what value does it add on top of existing innovations? Does the product or solution proposed solve that problem and to what degree? What is the big vision of the product?

##### 2. The business model and strategy

It is important to be able to present a well thought-out strategy and roadmap for execution and achieving growth. Which markets are to be targeted? What is the business model? How would the team sign up customers? How would the team monetize the product? What distribution channels are to be used? What is the timeline or schedule from this point forwards to achieve those results?

##### 3. The financials

It’s very important that the team presents and fully understands their financial numbers and projections, and is able to defend their assumptions of the business model presented.

##### 4. The product itself

In which state the product itself is now. Is there any dissonance between the presentation and what the judges perceive the product to be or is it in line with the presentation?  

##### 5. Competitive advantage

Has the team done thorough competitor analysis? Do they understand their competitors and their products & the advantages & disadvantages of those compared to the team.

##### 5. The preparation and presentation

Overall quality of the pitch. How well the structure is thought out, as in does the information presented make sense to the judge in the order it is presented. How uniform the presentation is. Is there any rough edges or does it all go as planned.

The level of preparation and effort put into the pitch are also judged.

* How representative the demo is of the possible final product
* How well the demo/testing situation is organized (if applicable)
* "Wow-factor"
* How much has been accomplished based on the hours worked on the project

##### 6. The Discussion and Questions

How satisfactory are the teams answers to judges questions. Can the team discuss about their idea in meaningful way and what is the quality of the discussion.

## Timetable and resources

You will find a detailed calendar with all the communal lectures and events from the TC7 workspace in Moodle and from Microsoft Teams. New events will appear as soon as they are arranged and we will try and give enough time to plan the production around these events.

During the Product Lab the students will work between 270h and 540h based on their own wishes. The amount of hours you are planning to do must be communicated to the group before the production starts. This should also be written into the project plan document. Learning and working will happen as described in the teams project plan documentation. JAMK will provide offices at Digi & Game Center. The group will plan and decide their working hours together and arrange it so that most people are attending all times.  

* 10 ECTS = ~15h/week
* 20 ECTS = ~30h/week
