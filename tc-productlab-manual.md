## Introduction

Ticorporate business simulation is based on "Information systems project" course, which has been part of Business Information Technologies degree programme from the start. Its purpose was to teach how to build information systems and how to do it as a part of a project group towards a common goal. In the autumn of 2013 Information systems project course extended to include theory studies when "Software production", "project management", and "modeling information systems" courses were integrated into it. After that process the course was named Ticorporate and its first iteration was called "Ticorporate MXIII". After the first Ticorporate the name was shortened to TC and a rolling number. Now we are at TC6.

After some yearly incremental updates it was decided that Ticorporate as it was is at its end. The course was split in half and that process gave birth to Ticorporate Demolab and Ticorporate Productlab. Year after that, the course was pushed forwards half a year, causing Demolab to start on 2nd year BIT students spring semester and Productlab to start on 3rd year students autumn semester.

Demolab is mandatory for all BIT students and Productlab is a part of elective professional studies. Demolabs purpose is basically the same as in every other year, to teach students how software projects and its roles work and to build a strictly defined game or software in a group setting. This document is created to describe Productlabs objectives and activities.

## Production process

Pre-production starts [when?]. Groups will get to know eachother better and arranges a workspace to their needs and wants. Roles are selected based on the production model choosed. Chosen roles should include at least a Scrum Master, Product Owner and [a person in charge of Business side of things]

When the roles and workstations are clear the groups will move on to the pre-production tasks. Pre-production can take as long as the group needs, but it shouldn't take too much time. Usually a full week should be enough. Labmaster (or Lecturer in Charge) will go through the pre-production material and discuss with the team about their findings.
